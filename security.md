# Security on OAuth 2.0 protocol

This article will mainly be about security on OAuth 2.0 protocol. You will learn about how to prevent malicious attacks.

## Using Authorization Code

OAuth 2.0 is a widely used authorization protocol that enables third-party applications to access user-owned resources without revealing the user's credentials. The authorization code grant type is one of the most secure OAuth 2.0 flow and it is used in web applications. In this flow, the client requests an authorization code from the authorization server, which is then exchanged for an access token and a refresh token.

The security of the OAuth 2.0 protocol with the authorization code grant type is based on several factors. First, the authorization code is short-lived, meaning that it expires after a few minutes. This reduces the risk of the code being stolen and used maliciously. Second, the authorization code is passed from the client to the authorization server through a secure channel, such as HTTPS, to prevent eavesdropping.

Another factor contributing to the security of the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type is the use of the state parameter. The state parameter is a random string that is generated by the client and included in the authorization request. It is then returned to the client in the redirect URI along with the authorization code. The client can use the state parameter to verify that the response came from the expected authorization server and to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

The access token, which is issued by the authorization server after the authorization code is exchanged, is also important for the security of the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type. Access tokens are short-lived and encrypted, making them difficult to steal. Additionally, access tokens are issued for specific resources and scopes, meaning that the client can only access the resources for which it has been granted permission.

In conclusion, the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type provides a secure mechanism for third-party applications to access user-owned resources. The use of short-lived authorization codes, secure communication channels, state parameters, and encrypted access tokens all contribute to the security of this flow. As a result, it is widely used in web applications and is considered to be one of the most secure OAuth 2.0 flows.




## Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is a security extension to the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. It provides additional protection for public clients, such as native mobile apps and single-page web applications, that are vulnerable to authorization code interception attacks.

In an OAuth 2.0 authorization flow with PKCE, the client generates a code verifier and a code challenge when it initiates the authorization request. The code challenge is hashed and sent to the authorization server in the authorization request. The authorization server then issues an authorization code, which is sent to the client. When the client exchanges the authorization code for an access token, it must also provide the original code verifier. The authorization server then hashes the code verifier and compares it to the code challenge it received in the original authorization request. If the hashes match, the client is confirmed to be the same client that originally requested the authorization code, and the access token is issued.

PKCE provides an additional layer of security for public clients by ensuring that an authorization code can only be used by the client that originally requested it. This helps to prevent authorization code theft, even if the code is intercepted or stolen during transit. PKCE is an optional extension to the OAuth 2.0 framework, but it is widely supported and recommended for use in public client scenarios.

#### Benefits of PKCE
- Protection against Code Theft: The Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) provides a secure mechanism for preventing unauthorized use of an authorization code. By requiring a code verifier, PKCE ensures that the authorization code can only be used by the original client that requested it, even if the code is intercepted or stolen during transit.

- Enhanced Security for Public Clients: Public clients, such as native mobile apps or single-page web applications, are vulnerable to attacks because they cannot securely store client secrets. PKCE provides an additional layer of security for these clients by ensuring that the authorization code can only be used by the client that originally requested it, even in the absence of a client secret.

- Improved User Experience: By eliminating the need for client secrets, PKCE simplifies the authorization process and makes it easier for users to grant access to their resources. This improved user experience can lead to increased adoption of OAuth 2.0 and greater trust in the security of the authorization process. Additionally, PKCE can be used to improve the security of OAuth 2.0 flows that rely on implicit grants, making it easier for organizations to implement secure authorization flows that meet their specific needs.
