# OpenID Connect Standard

OpenID Connect is a standard for authentication and authorization, which is built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. It allows for the secure and efficient authentication of users across different web and mobile applications.

In OpenID Connect, an "Identity Provider" (IdP) performs the user authentication and provides information about the user, such as their name and email, to the "Relying Party" (RP), which is the application requesting the user's information. The IdP generates a unique "ID Token" that contains this information, and the RP can then use this token to authenticate the user and provide them with access to the application.

One of the key benefits of OpenID Connect is that it provides a standardized, secure way for users to log in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials. This eliminates the need for users to create separate username and password combinations for each individual application, and it also helps to ensure that sensitive user information is stored securely by the IdP.

Overall, OpenID Connect is an important step forward in the development of secure, user-friendly authentication and authorization protocols for the web and mobile devices.

## ID Token

An ID Token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains information about an authenticated user. The ID Token is generated by the Identity Provider (IdP) and passed to the Relying Party (RP), which is the application that the user is trying to access.

An example of a simplified ID Token:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://idp.kraikub.com",
  "sub": "user12345",
  "aud": "https://rp.example.com",
  "exp": 1623276400,
  "name": "John Appleseed",
  "email": "john.appleseed@example.com"
}
```

In this example, the `iss` (issuer) claim indicates the Identity Provider that issued the token, the `sub` (subject) claim contains a unique identifier for the user, the `aud` (audience) claim identifies the Relying Party that the token is intended for, the `exp` (expiration) claim specifies when the token will expire, and the `name` and `email` claims contain additional information about the user.

It's important to note that this is just a simple example, and in a real-world implementation, the ID Token would likely contain many more claims and be signed with a digital signature to ensure its authenticity.
